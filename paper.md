# Summary

PredictRisk is a comprehensive Python package for Bayesian cardiovascular risk assessment with explicit uncertainty quantification. The software implements a modular architecture with eight specialized modules, demonstrating substantial scholarly effort in both statistical methodology and software engineering. Unlike existing cardiovascular risk tools that provide only point estimates, PredictRisk uniquely combines advanced Bayesian inference with comprehensive uncertainty quantification, professional software engineering practices, and a complete synthetic data generation framework. The package features six independent Bayesian logistic regression models for major cardiovascular conditions, a sophisticated web interface built with Streamlit, comprehensive PDF report generation, and extensive validation frameworks. PredictRisk has been successfully deployed and is actively used for cardiovascular risk research and education, distinguishing itself through its focus on uncertainty communication, open-source methodology, and modular architecture designed for extensibility.

# Statement of need

Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of global mortality, yet existing risk assessment tools suffer from significant limitations [@roth2020global]. Current clinical tools like the Framingham Risk Score and ASCVD Risk Calculator provide only point estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their utility for informed decision-making [@dagostino2008general; @goff20142013]. Unlike existing health informatics packages that focus on specific aspects of medical data analysis, PredictRisk uniquely addresses the critical gap of uncertainty-aware cardiovascular risk assessment.

**Unique Contributions Compared to Existing Software:**

While the health informatics landscape includes packages for electrocardiogram processing, survival analysis, and epidemiological modeling, PredictRisk is specifically designed for comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment with several distinctive features:

1. **Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification**: Unlike deterministic risk calculators, PredictRisk provides full posterior distributions and credible intervals for every prediction
2. **Comprehensive Synthetic Data Framework**: Includes complete data generation methodology with realistic correlations, enabling privacy-preserving research and education
3. **Multi-Condition Assessment**: Simultaneous modeling of six major cardiovascular conditions with consistent methodology
4. **Educational Focus**: Designed specifically for teaching Bayesian methods in healthcare applications with transparent methodology
5. **Professional Package Architecture**: Modular design supporting easy extension and integration into larger healthcare systems

From a software engineering perspective, most existing cardiovascular risk tools are proprietary, closed-source systems that cannot be modified, extended, or validated by the research community. This creates barriers to methodological improvements, limits educational applications, and prevents researchers from building upon existing work.

PredictRisk fills this gap by providing an open-source, professionally-engineered platform that combines sophisticated Bayesian statistical methods with user-friendly interfaces. The software serves multiple user communities: (1) researchers studying cardiovascular risk modeling methodologies, (2) healthcare professionals seeking accessible risk assessment tools with uncertainty quantification, (3) data scientists learning Bayesian approaches to medical prediction, (4) educators teaching statistical methods in healthcare, and (5) individuals interested in understanding their cardiovascular risk profile.

## Comparison with Existing Software

While several health informatics packages exist in the Python ecosystem, PredictRisk addresses a specific gap in cardiovascular risk assessment:

- **Pyheartlib**: Focuses on electrocardiogram signal processing, while PredictRisk provides risk prediction and assessment
- **lifelines**: Provides survival analysis tools, while PredictRisk specializes in Bayesian cardiovascular risk modeling
- **epimargin**: Offers epidemiological estimation tools, while PredictRisk focuses specifically on individual cardiovascular risk assessment with uncertainty quantification
- **General medical packages**: Most existing tools provide deterministic predictions without uncertainty quantification

PredictRisk's unique combination of Bayesian uncertainty quantification, multi-condition assessment, synthetic data generation, and educational focus distinguishes it from existing health informatics software.

The statistical foundation employs six independent Bayesian logistic regression models implemented through the Bambi library [@capretto2022bambi], providing a high-level interface to PyMC [@salvatier2016probabilistic]. Each model demonstrates exceptional convergence properties (R-hat = 1.0) with effective sample sizes exceeding 2,570 for all parameters, utilizing No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) with four parallel chains and 1,000 draws per chain after 1,000 tuning steps.

• **Comprehensive Uncertainty Quantification**: Unlike deterministic risk calculators, every prediction includes full posterior distributions, 95% credible intervals, and detailed uncertainty analysis. The framework provides multiple confidence levels and statistical summaries.

• **Professional Web Interface**: The Streamlit-based interface provides an intuitive user experience with real-time validation, educational tooltips, and responsive design. The interface supports both individual assessments and educational demonstrations.

• **Advanced Report Generation**: PredictRisk automatically generates comprehensive PDF reports with professional formatting, risk visualization, personalized recommendations, and educational content. Reports can be customized for different use cases.

• **Synthetic Data Framework**: The package includes a complete synthetic data generation system with realistic correlations, enabling privacy-preserving research and educational applications. Data validation and quality assessment tools are built-in.

• **Extensible Architecture**: The modular design allows researchers to easily add new cardiovascular conditions, risk factors, or analysis methods. The package supports both programmatic usage and web-based interaction.

• **Educational Integration**: PredictRisk is specifically designed for teaching Bayesian methods in healthcare applications, with comprehensive documentation, example notebooks, and transparent methodology.
