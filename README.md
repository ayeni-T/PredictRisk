# üß† PredictRisk: Cardiovascular Diagnostic Tool

A comprehensive Bayesian machine learning application for predicting cardiovascular disease risk using personalized health data and advanced statistical modeling techniques.

## üéØ Project Vision & Objectives

### **Personal Motivation**

This project stems from recognizing a critical gap in cardiovascular risk awareness and prevention. The reality that many individuals remain unaware of their elevated cardiovascular risk until clinical intervention becomes critical represents a significant challenge in modern healthcare. The "silent killer" nature of conditions like hypertension means that by the time symptoms appear, significant damage may have already occurred.

This recognition highlighted a fundamental healthcare challenge: **the lack of accessible, personalized risk assessment tools** that could provide early warning signs and enable preventive action. Too often, people remain unaware of their cardiovascular risk until they face a medical emergency. I realized that if we could democratize access to sophisticated risk prediction and make it as easy as checking the weather, we could save lives through early intervention and lifestyle modifications.

### **Technical Vision**

This project was developed with the goal of democratizing cardiovascular risk assessment through cutting-edge statistical methods. Healthcare decisions benefit from understanding the range of possible outcomes and the uncertainty inherent in predictions. By leveraging Bayesian statistics, PredictRisk provides comprehensive risk predictions with **credible intervals** that communicate this uncertainty effectively.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Address the critical gap in early cardiovascular risk detection** by creating accessible assessment tools
- Bridge the gap between complex statistical models and practical healthcare applications
- Demonstrate the power of Bayesian inference in medical risk prediction
- Provide transparent, interpretable risk assessments with uncertainty quantification
- Create an accessible tool for educational and research purposes in cardiovascular epidemiology
- **Empower individuals** to take proactive steps in their cardiovascular health journey

## üî¨ Statistical Methodology

### **Dataset & Data Generation**
**Important Note**: The current models are trained on **synthetically generated data** created through statistical simulation. This synthetic dataset was designed to:
- Reflect realistic distributions of cardiovascular risk factors
- Maintain appropriate correlations between variables observed in epidemiological literature
- Provide a foundation for methodology development and proof-of-concept demonstration
- Enable open-source sharing without privacy concerns

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- **Sample Size**: 500 simulated patient records
- **Variables**: 18 cardiovascular risk factors with realistic value ranges (age, BMI, lipid profiles, blood pressure, lifestyle factors, family history)
- **Outcome Variables**: 6 cardiovascular conditions with logistic regression-based risk modeling
- **Generation Method**: Statistical simulation using numpy random sampling from normal and binomial distributions with clinically plausible parameter ranges

### **Bayesian Logistic Regression Framework**
The application employs **Bayesian logistic regression models** implemented through the Bambi library (Built on PyMC). This represents a **methodologically sophisticated approach** to cardiovascular risk assessment. Each cardiovascular condition is modeled independently using:

- **Model Family**: Bernoulli likelihood with logit link function
- **Sampling Method**: No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) with four chains
- **Posterior Estimation**: 1,000 draws per chain after 1,000 tuning steps
- **Convergence Diagnostics**: R-hat statistics and effective sample size monitoring
- **Synthetic Data Foundation**: Statistically generated dataset using clinically plausible parameter distributions

**Key Methodological Innovation**: This Bayesian framework provides full posterior distributions for risk assessment, enabling probabilistic inference with explicit uncertainty quantification through credible intervals.

### **Predictor Variables**
The synthetic dataset contains 18 variables, but each Bayesian model uses a subset of 11 evidence-based risk factors:
- **Demographic**: Age
- **Anthropometric**: BMI  
- **Biomarkers**: Glucose levels, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, heart rate
- **Lifestyle**: Smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, sleep duration
- **Psychosocial**: Stress score (1-10 scale)

*Note: Additional variables in the dataset (HDL/LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, diet score, family history) are available for future model enhancements.*

### **Uncertainty Quantification**
Our Bayesian approach provides:
- **Posterior predictive distributions** for individual risk assessment
- **95% credible intervals** representing uncertainty in predictions
- **Full posterior samples** enabling rich probabilistic inference

### **Model Validation & Diagnostics**
All models undergo rigorous validation:
- Convergence assessment via R-hat statistics (all < 1.01)
- Effective sample size evaluation (ESS > 400 for all parameters)
- Posterior predictive checks for model adequacy

**‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations:**
- Models are trained on synthetic data and require validation on real clinical datasets
- Performance metrics reflect synthetic data characteristics, not real-world clinical outcomes
- Clinical applicability pending validation studies with actual patient data

## üî¨ Methodological Approach

**PredictRisk employs advanced Bayesian statistical methods for cardiovascular risk assessment:**

- **Bayesian Statistical Foundation**: Uses sophisticated probabilistic modeling for risk prediction
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides 95% credible intervals and full posterior distributions
- **Synthetic Data Methodology**: Built on statistically simulated data with transparent generation process
